1. Project Overview

The Online Bookstore Application is a Java-based web application developed using Spring Boot and MySQL. The primary goal of this application is to allow users to browse, add, and manage books in an online store.

2. Technologies Used

Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Database: MySQL
Build Tool: Maven
Version Control: Git
Containerization: Docker (for deployment)
3. Features

User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
Book Management: Users can view a list of available books, view detailed information about each book, add new books, and delete existing books.
Order Management: Users can place orders for books and view their order history (this feature can be extended with additional development).
RESTful API: The application exposes RESTful endpoints for interacting with the data.
4. Application Structure

The application follows a typical Spring Boot structure, with separate packages for controllers, services, repositories, and models. The main components include:

BookController: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
BookService: Contains business logic for managing books.
BookRepository: Interacts with the MySQL database to perform CRUD operations.
Book: Represents the book entity.
5. Database Schema

The database schema includes a single table, book, with fields for id, title, author, and price. The schema is defined in the schema.sql file and is automatically created when the application starts.

6. Deployment

The application can be containerized using Docker for easy deployment. A Dockerfile can be created to define the container image, and Docker Compose can be used to manage multi-container deployments if necessary.

7. Future Enhancements

User Authentication and Authorization: Implement a secure authentication system using Spring Security.
Order Management: Extend the application to include order management and payment processing.
Search and Filtering: Add advanced search and filtering options for books.
Front-end Development: Develop a user-friendly front-end using a framework like React or Angular.
8. Conclusion

The Online Bookstore Application demonstrates the use of Java and Spring Boot to create a robust and scalable web application. With further enhancements and features, it can be developed into a full-fledged e-commerce platform. The codebase is modular and follows best practices, making it easy to extend and maintain.
